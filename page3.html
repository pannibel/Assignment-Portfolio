        <p>In this assignment we had to implement a responsive layout to a mockup landing page. No fonts or colors were provided so I reused my fonts from the first assignment and picked a new color scheme with images that also matched the overall aesthetic. The fonts and font-hierarchy stayed for the same reason, being easily readable and easy to work with in flexboxes. I also applied the rounded corners and slight drop shadows to the cards and images throughout the page, to give them a modern and minimal look. The page resizes smoothly, the flexbox elements forming one vertical line as the window narrows.</p>
